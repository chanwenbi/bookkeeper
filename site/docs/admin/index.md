This document is a guide to deploying, administering, and maintaining BookKeeper. It will cover three main areas:

- How to deploy a BookKeeper cluster to production, including best practices and important configuration that should (or should not!) be changed.
- How to perform post-deployment logistics, such as a rolling restart or upgrade of your cluster.
- How to monitor your cluster's vital statistics, understanding which behaviors are normal and which should be cause for alarm and interpreting various stats provided by BookKeeper.

The main topics are covered as below:

- [Production Deployment](./production)
- [Post Deployment](./post-deployment)
- [Auto Recovery](./autorecovery)
- [Monitoring BookKeeper](./monitoring)
